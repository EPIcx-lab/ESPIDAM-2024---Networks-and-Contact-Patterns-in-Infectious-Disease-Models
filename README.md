# ESPIDAM (2024) - Networks and Contact Patterns in Infectious Disease Models
This repository contains the code for: *Practical on the Use and Analysis of Mobility Data* and *Practical on Modeling Spatial Transmission*

## Getting Started
For these practical lessons, we will use Python facilitated by Jupyter for interactive coding. Here's a quick setup guide:

**Recommended**
1) If Jupyter isn't already on your system, start by downloading Anaconda from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
2) Once Anaconda is installed, simply open Anaconda Navigator and launch JupyterLab (or Jupyter Notebook).
3) Additionally, we require a set of libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, geopandas, and statsmodels. You can install these with either `conda install pandas numpy matplotlib geopandas statsmodels` or `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib geopandas statsmodels` in your terminal or command prompt.

**Alternative**  
If you encounter issues running Jupyter on your computer, an alternative option is available on Google Colab, where you can execute the entire code online without any local installation. Access the notebooks at the following links:
- [Notebook_1]()
- [Notebook_2.0]()
- [Notebook_2.1]()
